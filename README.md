# Final work presented in EMAp-FGV summer course - 2018

The main folder (Verao_2018) contains:

- Poloniex_franklin.py: a .py file which contains some code I wrote to: collect data information on a cryptocurrency from POLONIEX, store this data into .csv files and store pandas data frames into a SQL .db file. 

- POLONIEX - 3 currencies - Franklin.ipynb: a notebook which explains, step by step, how each requirement, from the list below, was addressed:

    1. Data on 3 cryptocurrencies should be collected (p.s.: I've chosen to use Poloniex's API);
    2. A SQL database should be used to store the data. 
    3. Read information from the SQL database and present it in 5 different graphs. 

P.S.: this work was assigned as a requirement for approval in the summer course in Introduction to Programming with the Python Language -  [EMAp, FGV](https://emap.fgv.br/) (2018).
